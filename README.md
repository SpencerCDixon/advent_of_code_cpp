# Advent Of Code C++

I've decided to take part in AoC this year! To spice things up, I've decided to
use these challenges as a way to start fleshing out my own standard library
(and thus learn more core C++ skillz). I'm adding a few additional rules to my
participation:

**Rules**

* No STL
* No dependencies (other than C stdlib)

I'll probably start by first solving the challenges with raw C and as I feel
like I need abstractions I'll create new data structures. 

I've set up some testing infrastructure so I can port the solutions to use the new data
structures and ensure previous challenges are still correct.

## Scripts

* `test.sh` - runs all library and challenge tests

## Libraries

* `LibSD` - Spencer Dixon's standard library
* `LibAOC` - Utilities for solving challenges
